# This is Randopster

It takes a set of topster images, and returns a random album recommendation.

To run, create a conda environment using the following command:

conda create --name randopenv --file env.txt

Activate the environment, and within do:

pip install coverpy

Run with:

python dev_randopster.py

# To Note

CV2 is used to display topster images. To proceed from an image press any key. If the window is closed the program will hang. 

# TODO

When initializing a new environment one might encounter an issue with cv2. Resolve.
